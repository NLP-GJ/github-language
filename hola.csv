Built on a 2016 MacBook Pro with 4 physical CPUs.', 'There are many web application bundlers out there with huge adoption, including webpack and browserify. So, why do we need another one? The main reasons are around developer experience.', 'Many bundlers are built around configuration and plugins, and it is not uncommon to see applications with upwards of 500 lines of configuration just to get things working. This configuration is not just tedious and time consuming, but is also hard to get right and must be duplicated for each application. Oftentimes, this can lead to sub-optimized apps shipping to production. parcel is designed to need zero configuration: just point it at the entry point of your application, and it does the right thing.', 'Existing bundlers are also very slow. Large applications with lots of files and many dependencies can take minutes to build, which is especially painful during development, when things change all the time. File watchers can help with rebuilds, but the initial launch is often still very slow.', 'parcel utilizes worker processes to compile your code in parallel, utilizing modern multicore processors. This results in a huge boost in speed for initial builds. It also has a file system cache, which saves the compiled results per file, for even faster subsequent startups.', ""Finally, existing bundlers are built around string loaders/transforms, where the transform takes in a string, parses it, does some transformation, and generates code again. Oftentimes, this ends up causing many parses and code generation runs on a single file, which is inefficient. Instead, parcel's transforms work on ASTs, so that there is one parse, many transforms, and one code generation per file."", ""parcel transforms a tree of assets into a tree of bundles. Many other bundlers are fundamentally based around JavaScript assets, with other formats tacked on - for example, by default inlined as strings into JS files. parcel is file-type agnostic - it will work with any type of assets the way you'd expect, with no configuration."", 'parcel takes as input a single entry asset, which could be any file type: JS, HTML, CSS, image, etc. There are various asset types defined in parcel which know how to handle specific file types. The assets are parsed, their dependencies are extracted, and they are transformed to their final compiled form. This creates a tree of assets.', 'Once the asset tree has been constructed, the assets are placed into a bundle tree. A bundle is created for the entry asset, and child bundles are created for dynamic imports, which cause code splitting to occur. Child bundles are also created when assets of a different type are imported. For example, if you imported a CSS file from JavaScript, it would be placed into a sibling bundle in correlation to the associated JavaScript file. If an asset is required in more than one bundle, it is hoisted up to the nearest common ancestor in the bundle tree, so it is not included more than once.', 'After the bundle tree is constructed, each bundle is written to a file by a packager specific to the file type.

It is only displayed once.\nThis project uses express-flash module for flash messages. And that\nmodule is built on top of connect-flash, which is what I used in\nthis project initially. With express-flash you don't have to\nexplicitly send a flash message to every view inside res.render().\nAll flash messages are available in your views via messages object by default,\nthanks to express-flash."", ""Flash messages have a two-step process. You use req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }\nto create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:"", ""In the first step, 'errors' is the name of a flash message, which should match the\nname of the property on messages object in your views. You place alert messages\ninside if message.errors because you don't want to show them flash messages are present.\nThe reason why you pass an error like { msg: 'Error message goes here' } instead\nof just a string - 'Error message goes here', is for the sake of consistency.\nTo clarify that, express-validator module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,\nreturns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a msg property with a message why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:"", 'To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages\nas { msg: \'My flash message\' } instead of a string. Otherwise, you will see an alert box\nwithout an error message. That is because in partials/flash.pug template it will try to output\nerror.msg (i.e. ""My flash message"".msg), in other words, it will try to call a msg method on a String object,\nwhich will return undefined.

The main file app.js contains all the routes.\nEach route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see three or more arguments for a route. In a case like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments\nare what\'s called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from\ncontinuing forward, you won\'t get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.', 'It always goes from left to right. A user visits /account page. Then isAuthenticated middleware checks if you are authenticated:', 'If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your ""door"" by calling return next();.
